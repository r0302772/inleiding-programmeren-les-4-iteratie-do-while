### Excercise 3

We read the first name, the last name and the date of birth of 4 people. The age group is now determined by the date of birth. Study the table below carefully. The first and last name must be entered. The date of birth must be a valid date. Of course we do not accept a future date of birth.
Tip: you determine the age by decreasing the current year by the year of birth.

| Minimum age | Age group |
| ----------- |:---------:|
| 18          | Adult     |
| 10          | Teenager  |

### Exercise 4

The user is shown a sentence, namely 'there is a sun hat and gingerbread on the chair'. The intention is that he can study these quietly. After studying, he will have the opportunity to reproduce this sentence. Some users will immediately fill in the sentence correctly, others need several chances.
Keep in mind that the sentence can be easily modified by the programmer and that the program will still run flawlessly.

### Exercise 5

This exercise is an extension of '2 Selection exercise 5'.
Calculate the points after throwing 3 darts on a bird cock. For this we have to check where the arrow ends up and depending on that the corresponding points are calculated. After throwing all darts, the total number of points is printed.

- landing place 1 = Outside the board: 0 points 
- landing place 2 = Outer ring: 20 points
- landing place 3 = Inner ring: 50 points 
- landing place 4 = In the bull's eye: 100 points

Program efficiently. Keep in mind that the number of arrows can change. Use the following string variable to print points distribution, each time on a clean screen. The title is printed which arrow is to be thrown.

### Exercise 6

The user must specify a minimum value and a maximum value. Both values must be integers and the maximum value must be greater than the minimum value.
We now let the computer retrieve a random number 3 times, which lies between the specified minimum and maximum value (including the limits).
The user can then guess which random number the computer has determined. Finally, we get a message how many attempts the user needed.
